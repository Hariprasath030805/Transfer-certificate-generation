The project uses a pre-defined template for the TC and pulls data from an Excel file. When a user inputs an admission number, the system generates a TC with the relevant information.

Features
Template-Based TC Generation: Utilizes a predefined template to ensure consistent formatting.
Excel Data Integration: Pulls student data from an Excel file to fill in the TC details.
Admission Number Lookup: Generates the TC based on the provided admission number.

Prerequisites:-
Required Python libraries:"mailmerge","tkinter","openpyxl","os".
An Excel file (tcdataupload.xlsx) containing student information
A TC template file (tcupload.docx)
